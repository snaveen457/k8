So what is the total number of Kubernetes pods you have actually set up? What kind of, I think, various configurations you have of the Kubernetes as we came to understand? So what is the peak traffic of your cluster?

A) I have set up around **50-60 Kubernetes pods** across various projects. The configurations include:

- **Deployment Configurations**: For microservices with auto-scaling and load balancing.
- **StatefulSets**: For stateful applications like databases.
- **DaemonSets**: For logging and monitoring agents.
- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)**: For scaling based on CPU or memory usage.
  
The peak traffic handled by my cluster was around **1000-1500 requests per second**, with the cluster scaling automatically based on the load.


So what is the size of your cluster? Production, number of Kubernetes pods you said you have set up, right? And you give access control. But what is the number of pods you have set up which is like at peak traffic it runs? You should have some numbers, right? Some statistics as to at peak traffic we run 100 pods or 200 pods. What are the metrics you measure in your Kubernetes cluster?

At peak traffic, the cluster runs about **80-100 pods**. For monitoring, I measure metrics like **CPU usage, memory consumption, pod availability, request latency**, and **network traffic**. These are tracked using **Prometheus** and **CloudWatch** to ensure the cluster scales and performs efficiently.


Do you have any security protocols, firewalls to your Kubernetes cluster?

Yes, I implement several security protocols for Kubernetes clusters:

- **Network Policies**: To control traffic between pods.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: For managing user permissions.
- **Pod Security Policies**: To enforce security standards for pods.
- **Firewalls and Security Groups**: To restrict access to the cluster.
- **Image Scanning**: To detect vulnerabilities in container images.

 If I, as a developer, want to ping to the cluster, what kind of authentication or security mechanism should I put to sign up to the cluster?


To access the cluster as a developer, you should use:

- **Kubeconfig File**: Provides credentials and cluster access details.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Ensures you have the right permissions.
- **Service Accounts**: For application-specific access.
- **IAM Roles (in cloud environments)**: To manage authentication securely.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: For added security when accessing the cluster.

Which specific provider do you use IAM or AWS? AWS, IAD and Access Management, that is the authentication gateway. Do you use any single sign-on offerings of AWS?

I use **AWS IAM** for access management. For single sign-on (SSO), I use **AWS SSO** (now integrated with AWS IAM Identity Center) to enable seamless and secure access to the cluster and other AWS services.

Yeah, I think from a scalability point of view, right, when the number of requests comes and developers want to ask for logs for any application and how you will basically be able to troubleshoot. What are the security protocols? Like, if you're at the DevOps booth, do you give the logs directly or is there some security process you follow internally?

From a scalability and security perspective, handling log requests involves:

1. **Centralized Logging**: Use a centralized logging system (e.g., **ELK Stack**, **Splunk**, or **CloudWatch Logs**) to efficiently manage and scale log data.

2. **Access Control**: Implement strict access controls, ensuring only authorized users or roles can access logs. This can include role-based permissions and multi-factor authentication.

3. **Secure Access Channels**: Provide access to logs through secure, encrypted channels. Avoid direct handover of logs.

4. **Request and Approval Process**: Implement a formal process for log access requests, including documentation and approval workflows.

5. **Audit and Monitoring**: Maintain an audit trail of log access and requests, monitoring for any unauthorized or unusual activity.

6. **Data Masking and Redaction**: Ensure sensitive information within logs is masked or redacted to prevent exposure.

Logs are not typically handed over directly; instead, access is managed through secure, controlled methods, adhering to internal security protocols.
